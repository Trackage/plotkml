This is a fork of plotKML from R-forge. 

If you were born to have adventure, the trip branch has a method for `plotKML` for `trip` objects (from the [trip](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=enpls) package). 


```R
devtools::install_github("Trackage/plotkml/pkg@trip")
```

See README for the original provenance.
